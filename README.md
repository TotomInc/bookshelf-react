## Setup the project locally

### Prerequesites

- NodeJS LTS _(tested with v14.18.0)_
- npm v6 or greater
- Yarn v1 _(project created with Yarn, we recommend using it instead of npm)_

### Setup local environment

Make sure to clone the repository locally. You can make a fork first, before cloning, if you want to make changes.

Run the following commands to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```shell
# Replace this URL with your fork if you have done it.
# This URL will not let you push changes to my repository.
git clone https://github.com/TotomInc/bookshelf-react.git

cd bookshelf-react

# Install project dependencies with Yarn.
yarn install
```

## Running the app

To get the app running in development mode, run:

```shell
yarn run dev

# You should see an URL that points to your local environment server.
```

The app is also deployed with a production build on [react-bookshelf-exercise.netlify.app](https://react-bookshelf-exercise.netlify.app/), thanks to Netlify.
